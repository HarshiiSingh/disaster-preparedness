              Words, phrases, abbreviations, and acronyms relevant to emergency
              management should be defined. Many terms in emergency management
              have special meanings, so it is important to establish precise
              definitions. Such definitions allow the users of the EOP to share
              an understanding of the EOP.

                A blizzard is a severe snowstorm characterized by strong
                sustained winds and low visibility, lasting for a prolonged
                period of timeâ€”typically at least three or four hours. A ground
                blizzard is a weather condition where snow that has already
                fallen is being blown by wind. Blizzards can have an immense
                size and usually stretch to hundreds or thousands of kilometres.

                A snow storm (or winter storm) is an event in which wind
                coincides with varieties of precipitation that only occur at
                freezing temperatures, such as snow, mixed snow and rain, or
                freezing rain. In temperate continental and subarctic climates,
                these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter
                season, but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as
                well. A snowstorm with strong winds and low visibility is called
                a blizzard.

                A tropical cyclone is the generic term for a warm-cored,
                non-frontal synoptic-scale low-pressure system over tropical or
                subtropical waters around the world. The systems generally have
                a well-defined center which is surrounded by deep atmospheric
                convection and a closed wind circulation at the surface. A
                tropical cyclone is generally deemed to have formed once mean
                surface winds in excess of 35 kn (65 km/h; 40 mph) are observed.
                It is assumed at this stage that a tropical cyclone has become
                self-sustaining and can continue to intensify without any help
                from its environment.

                A wildfire, forest fire, or a bushfire is an unplanned,
                uncontrolled and unpredictable fire in an area of combustible
                vegetation. Depending on the type of vegetation present, a
                wildfire may be more specifically identified as a bushfire (in
                Australia), desert fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire,
                prairie fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Some natural forest
                ecosystems depend on wildfire. Modern forest management often
                engages in prescribed burns to mitigate fire risk and promote
                natural forest cycles. However, controlled burns can turn into
                wildfires by mistake.
